## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Up and Run Locally

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (v14 or later)
-   **npm** or **yarn**
-   **MongoDB:** You must have a MongoDB database running. You can either [install it locally](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tanishq112005/Todo_app.git
cd Todo_app
```

**2. Set up the Backend (Server):**
```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd backend

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the /server directory
touch .env
```
Now, open the `.env` file and add the following environment variables. You'll need to provide your own MongoDB connection string and a secret for JWT.

```env
# .env file for the server

#Your Port Number 
Port_number=3001        // any port number according to you  

# Your MongoDB connection URI
Mongo_db=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/yourDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority



**3. Set up the Frontend (Client):**
```bash
# Navigate back to the root and into the client directory
cd ../frontend

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Application

You can run both the client and server concurrently from the root directory with a single command.

```bash
# From the root directory 

# to run the backend 
cd backend 
cd src
ts-node index.ts 

# to run frontend 
cd frontend 
npm run dev 
```


-   The React frontend will be available at **`http://localhost:3000`**
-   The Express backend will be running on **`http://localhost:5000`** (or your specified port)
